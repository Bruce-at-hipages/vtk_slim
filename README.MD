PHP VTK SLIM Library

This is a trimmed down library based on the existing VTK_Library plus the original SMVC lib that I developed.

It aims at providing a quick start point for the following tasks:

* Fast utilities
* Fast db access and model management (DAO/Model + PDO adapters)
* Extensible
* Autoload
* PHP 5.3+ compatible (with namespaces)
* use JSON as the main data format for almost all parts
* Unit test using simple test
